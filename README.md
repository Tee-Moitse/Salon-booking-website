# 💅 Luxe Beauty Haven – Salon Booking Website

Luxe Beauty Haven is a responsive website built for a fictional beauty salon that offers services such as hair, lashes, and nails. The purpose of this website is to allow customers to **view available services**, **read reviews**, and **book appointments** online — including paying a **R50 deposit** to confirm their booking.
